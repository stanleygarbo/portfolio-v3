# The New Ormoc City App: A case study

>Ormoc City has been growing quite significantly over the recent years. There were innovations, new tech and new businesses. So I built an online platform for the City's technological advancement, to help new local businesses get attention. The platform will also be useful for locals as well as tourists since the platform was mainly designed to be a digital hub for information that's centered around the City and what it has to offer.

## Problem Statement

>The previous My Ormoc App had some rather buggy features that may intervene with the users' experience whilst using the app. The contact tracing system does not easily enable users to retrieve their QR codes once lost.

<div markdown="1" >

## Scope and Limitations

>This new platform allows admins to post articles of a certain category. Allows users of the City's contact tracing system to retrieve their QR codes with ease. Regular users will be limitted to only viewing, saving, and searching  articles.

## The Mobile App

>I leveraged my knowledge in React and was able to build the mobile app prototype with React Native, A hybrid framework that allows you to build an app that runs on both iOS and android whilst only having a single codebase. The Mobile app is the main software for user-consumption. This is where all content will be available that users are able to view. It currently has a graph that shows Covid-19 cases in the city.

## Integration with the contact tracing system
>One special feature of the app is that it can be integrated with the current contact tracing system in Ormoc (with collaboration). This feature has no certainty of being released unless if this project pushes through. I wanted this feature to be available mainly because of my observations and assumptions that users of the contact tracing system aren't able to retrieve their QR codes easily once they lose it. So I thought about bringing this feature to help them get or retrieve their QR codes with ease.

## The Web App
>The Web app is where admins can post/delete articles of a certain category. Each article that an admin posts must be of a certain category (e.g news, food, travel, hotels, etc). Only admins can add or make other admins.
